This repository is for a simulator I made for an original twisty puzzle that I designed in college.

The original twisty puzzle was designed in Solidworks, and the original simulator was designed in Matlab. I no longer have licenses for either software nor the original files, but I recreated the simulator in Python, and I recreated the CAD in OnShape. Please view the publicly available OnShape file [here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/6d13049500a96a43bc1b0cea/w/c66486e3c31c34519027e35c/e/2db2d1c96ce384fada7534fc?renderMode=0&uiState=6177407539ccad7c71141ecd).

After designing this puzzle, I realized it was analogous to the VeryPuzzle brand Snow Mystery puzzle.
